This repository contains a simple and clear AWS WordPress project setup using:

- EC2 (Amazon Linux 2023)
- RDS (MariaDB/MySQL)
- IAM Roles
- AWS Backup
- CloudWatch Monitoring (enabled through EC2 console)
- AMI backup image

CloudFront, Route53, and Auto Scaling Group are not used:
- CloudFront is not free tier
- Route53 was removed because the IP changes with ASG
- ASG removed because new instances break WordPress config

Everything is written in a beginner-friendly, step-by-step format.
